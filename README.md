# tropebrowser

Trope Browser is a client for the site TV Tropes.
It does not support editing pages (currently a limitation of Flutter), but can view them perfectly fine.


## Features
- You can view in either dark or light mode.
- Viewed tropes are saved, so after opening one you can come back and view it later.
- Open a random trope at any time.
- Toggle spoilers on/off.

## Usage
Simply type in your search term or TVTropes url into the search bar at the top, and the article will load.
Swiping to the right brings up the navigation drawer, and swiping to the left brings up saved articles.
